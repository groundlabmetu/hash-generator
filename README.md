# hash-generator

This code generates Argon2 hashes for ODTÜ student cards. Normally, the lab’s RFID reader reads the card UUID and creates the hash, but this can be difficult for some users. With this app, the hash is generated online via a web service instead of using the physical RFID reader.

The application was developed by Tolga Demirdal.
